# Wallbox QA Coding Test Solution

This repo contains a solution for the Technical Test provided by Wallbox

## Part I: Unit Testing

Write code to solve the following problems:

1. A function that given 2 vectors of integers finds the first repeated number

2. A function that given a path of the file system finds the first file that meets the
following requirements
a. The file owner is admin
b. The file is executable
c. The file has a size lower than 14*2^20

3. A function that given a sequence of coin flips (0 is tails, 1 is heads) finds the
minimum quantity of permutations so that the sequence ends interspersed. For
example, given the sequence 0,1,1,0 how many changes are needed so that the
result is 0,1,0,1


PS.: Incluse Pytest unit testing with at least 2 Tests
